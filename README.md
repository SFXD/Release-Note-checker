Release-Note-checker

A simple bash script to check if there are new release notes out.
Set it up on your server with a crontab, set your email in the script where useful, and get notified of new releases per email.
Note: this assumes you have Postfix or equivalent sending you mails that arrive in the server /var/mail/user.
