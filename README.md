Release-Note-checker

A simple bash script to check if there are new salesforce releases out.
Made to work with webhooks, sepcifically Discord ones.


Note that while the script technically works, it is considered deprecated and fully superseded by a Huginn job.
This repository will not be maintained further, but you can open issues for new releases or extra things to monitor, and these will be added to the huginn jobs.
